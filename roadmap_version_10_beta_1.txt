About the next version of PicoChess.

July 29, 2020

Introduction:

At the moment, PicoChess 0.9n is the latest official version as created by Jürgen Précour. This version is over two years old now. The latest image, created using this version, is also becoming outdated, as it doesn't run on the Raspberry Pi 4.

Goals:

- Create a new image, on the basis of Buster, which is the latest Raspberry Pi OS version at the time of writing.
- Integrate PicoChess community efforts in to the main repository and into this new image.
	* Updated requirements.txt with the latest working dependencies that do NOT require code change in PicoChess, created by Alan (Al, Scally.)
	* Install the latest version of dgtpicom and dgtpicom.so, created by Lucas.
	* Install Eric's Bluetooth Fix script.
	
Why version number 10:

Wilhelm and Dirk have collaborated on forks of PicoChess. These are personal versions, with changes that where never pushed into the main repositories. These versions are called PicoChess 1.0, 2.0, and 2.01. Also there's an image, created by Alan, that is called PicoChess 2.01+, which contains both PicoChess 2.01 and 0.9n, allowing the user to switch between those versions. This image also contains a lot more software such as additional engines.

Dirk has asked to not develop new versions on top of his own (open source) code, as he feels that his code quality is not good enough to be in the main repository. (Which is entirely his opinion: at the time of writing this, I haven't yet inspected any PicoChess code from any version.)

As version 1.0 and 2.0 have already been taken and well known in the community, even though they are personal version, the new main version of PicoChess will be 10. (As in: 1.0, but with the dot removed.)

Version 10 will not contain any changes to the code. It will contain updates to external files and dependencies. A dependency will be updated to the highest version number possible that does NOT require code changes in PicoChess.

After version 10:

After version 10 is established and the new main image is created, itt is the intent to upgrade dependencies further.

To keep the number of fixes doable, dependencies will be upgraded one by one, and one version at a time.

So, upgrade Tornado Webserver from 4.5.1 => 4.5.2 => 4.5.3.

If necessary, PicoChess' code will be changed to accomodate the update.

Each time a dependency is updated and then requires a code change, PicoChess' version number will be raised by 0.1. When a dependency reaches the latest version (in the case of Tornado, in this example, that would be version 6.0.4) and is confirmed working after testing, PicoChess' version number will be raised by 1.

So, the in-between updates of Tornado will see PicoChess 10.1, 10.2, and so on; and after Tornado reaches it's current latest version (6.0.4) and PicoChess is updated to match, the PicoChess version will be 11.

Then, the next dependency will be updated, eventually resulting in PicoChess 12... and so on.
